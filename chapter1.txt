It was the best of times	

Working Directory -> Where the git file is initialized, and where git will track changes between local repository

Git add
Staging Area -> where we can choose what files to add to local repository

Git commit with commit message
Local Repository 

Git diff will show the differences that have occurred	


Everything changed when the Venusian nation attacked!
